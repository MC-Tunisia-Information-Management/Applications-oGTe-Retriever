# Applications-oGTe-Retriever
The function `getOpportunityApplications_oGTe` retrieves data from the AIESEC Opportunities API for opportunities tagged with programme ID 9 (oGTe) within a specified date range. It constructs a GraphQL query to fetch details such as application ID, applicant's full name, phone number, managers, backgrounds, creation date, host LC name, home MC name, current application status, opportunity title, opportunity ID, duration type, and programme short name. The retrieved data is parsed and written into a Google Sheets spreadsheet named "ðŸ“– applications | oGTe". The function handles null values gracefully using conditional checks and mapping functions, ensuring comprehensive data capture from the API response.
